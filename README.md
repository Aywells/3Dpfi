1. The existing studies with experimentally determined 3D structures of protein folding intermediates
This section lists the studies that our literature search has identified which report 3D structures of experimentally identified post-translational or co-translational folding intermediates. We provide direct links to the published studies and the PDB entries for the structures of intermediates used in our analyses.

Neudecker et al. (2012): Fyn SH3 domain
PDB IDs: 2L2P (intermediate 1), 2L25 (intermediate 2)
Zhou et al. (2008): RNase H
PDB IDs: 2RPI (intermediate 1), 1RIL (intermediate 2)
Co-translational intermediates (Section 2.2 in the main paper):
Agirrezabala et al. (2022): Cold shock protein A (CspA)
PDB IDs: 7NWW (intermediate 1a), 7OIF (intermediate 1b), 7OIG (intermediate 1c), 7OT5 (intermediate 2a), 7OII (intermediate 2b), 1MJC (intermediate 2c)
